# Challenges and the Learning Process
As someone who has been on the observing end of backend development, working on a full stack project from start to finish has been a very fun, challenging, and rewarding process. Resources used to put together the backend were Udemy, Youtube, Google, and studying backend code files from projects I have/am a part of.
